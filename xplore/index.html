        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take data security seriously and use industry-standard methods to protect your information. However, while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data shared over the internet or wireless networks.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Xplore integrates with third-party services such as Google Sign-In for user authentication, Google Drive for cloud file storage, and Wikipedia for content access through WikiXplore. When using these services, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective third-party providers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>URL Shortening:</strong> To provide URL shortening functionality, we use a third-party service called CleanURL (https://cleanuri.com/). When a user shortens a link, the original URL is sent to CleanURL's servers to generate a shortened version. CleanURL may collect anonymized usage data as described in their own Privacy Policy. We do not share any personally identifiable information (PII) with CleanURL.</p>

        <h2>6. reCAPTCHA Enterprise</h2>
        <p>We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise to help protect our service from fraud and abuse. When you use our app, reCAPTCHA Enterprise may collect hardware and software information, such as device and application data, to provide its security service. This data is handled in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy. By using our app, you acknowledge and consent to the collection and processing of this data by reCAPTCHA Enterprise as part of our security measures to protect our platform.</p>

        <h2>7. Messaging Data</h2>
        <p>Messages sent via the app, along with their timestamps, are stored on our servers for up to 24 hours from the time they are sent. After 24 hours, these messages are automatically deleted. If you explicitly uninstall the app, upon reinstallation, the app will fetch any messages that remain within the 24-hour window.</p>

        <h2>8. Personal Notes Data</h2>
        <p>Notes created within the app are stored locally on your device. We do not collect or store your notes on our servers. When you export notes, they are saved as text files on your device's storage.</p>

        <h2>9. Camera Data</h2>
        <p>The app only uses your camera to scan QR codes. No photos or videos are recorded or saved from your camera unless explicitly mentioned.</p>

        <h2>10. Google Account Information</h2>
        <p>Xplore collects the username associated with your Google account when you sign in. This information is used for identification within the app and to enhance your user experience. We do not store passwords or sensitive Google account information.</p>

        <h2>11. Wikipedia Content</h2>
        <p>Content accessed through WikiXplore is retrieved from Wikipedia and is subject to Wikipedia's terms of use and Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (CC BY-SA 3.0).</p>
